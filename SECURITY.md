# Security

If you discover a security issue, please don’t open a public issue.  
Instead, reach out privately at **<security@barnes.biz>** or use GitHub’s “Report a vulnerability” option.

Include as much detail as you can (steps to reproduce, impact, affected version).  
I’ll review and respond as soon as possible. Thanks for helping keep things safe.
